## Kubernetes Workloads Integration

Kubernetes has several built-in resources that encapsulate running _Pods_. These are called [Kubernetes Workloads](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/){target=\_blank} and **should not be confused** with Run:ai Workloads.

Examples of such resources are a _Deployment_ that manages a stateless application, or a _Job_ that runs tasks to completion.

Run:ai natively runs Run:ai Workloads. A Run:ai workload encapsulates all the resources needed to run, creates them, and deletes them together. However, Run:ai, being an **open platform** allows the scheduling of **any** Kubernetes Workflow.

For more information see [Kubernetes Workloads Integration](../developer/cluster-api/other-resources.md).
