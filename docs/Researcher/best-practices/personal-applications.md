# Personal Applications

This article explains the procedure to create personal applications.

Applications are used for API integrations with Run:ai. An application contains a client ID and a client secret. Using the client credentials you can obtain a token and use it within subsequent API calls.

Personal applications are managed locally and assigned with the user's Access Rules to manage its permissions. TBD
