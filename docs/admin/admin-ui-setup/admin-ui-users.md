## Introduction

The Run:ai UI allows you to manage all of the users in the Run:ai platform. There are two types of users, **local** users and **SSO** users. Local users are users that are created and managed in the Run:ai platform and SSO users are authorized to use the Run:ai platform using an identity provider. All users are assigned levels of access to all aspects of the UI including submitting jobs on the cluster.

!!! Tip
    It is possible to connect the Run:ai UI to the organization's directory and use single sign-on (SSO). This allows you to set Run:ai roles for users and groups from the organizational directory. For further information see [single sign-on configuration](../runai-setup/authentication/authentication-overview.md).

## Create a User

!!! Note

    * To be able to review, add, update and delete users, you must have *System Administrator* access. To upgrade your access, contact a system administrator.
    * When SSO is enabled, users created using the procedure below will be local users only. You can only provide SSO users with access to the system. You cannot create new SSO users.

To create a new user:

1. Login to the Run:ai UI at `company-name.run.ai`.
2. Press the ![Tools and Settings](img/tools-and-settings.svg) icon, then select *Users*.
3. Press *New user* and enter the user's email address, then press *Create*.
4. Review the new user information and note the temporary password that has been assigned.
5. Press *Done* when complete.

## Users Table

The *Users* table displays a list of users who are authorized to login to the Run:ai platform.

!!! Note
    SSO users who have not logged into the Run:ai platform will not appear in the table until they do.

The *Users* table contains information about local users which have been created and SSO users who have logged into the Run:ai Platform. The table includes columns for:

* **User**&mdash;the email address which is the user identifier.
* **Type**&mdash;the type of user (local or SSO).
* **Last login**&mdash;the last time the user logged into the platform.
* **Access rule(s)**&mdash;press *VIEW* to view the access rule(s) assigned to the user.
* **Created by**&mdash;indicates who created the user in the able.
* **Creation time**&mdash;the timestamp for when the user was created.
* **Last updated**&mdash;the last time the user information was updated.

When you press *View* in the *Access rule(s)* column, a pop-up will appear that displays the rules assigned to the user. In the popup are the following columns:

* **Role**&mdash;the name of the role assigned to the user.
* **Scope**&mdash;the scope to which the user has rights.
* **Type**&mdash;the type of subject assigned to the access rule (User or SSO group)
* **Group**&mdash;the name of the group assigned to the access rule, in case the access rule is inherited from an SSO group.
* **Authorized by**&mdash;the user who granted the access rule.
* **Creation time**&mdash;the timestamp for when the rule was created.
* **Last updated**&mdash;the last time the rule information was updated.

## Assigning access rules to users

Once you have created the users you can assign them *Access rules*. This provides the needed authorization to access system assets and resources.

### Roles and permissions

Roles provide a way for administrators to group and identify collections of permissions that administrators assign to [subjects](../runai-setup/access-control/rbac.md#subjects). Permissions define the actions that can be performed on managed entities. The [Roles](../runai-setup/access-control/rbac.md#roles) table shows the default roles and permissions that come with the system. See [Role based access control](../runai-setup/access-control/rbac.md) for more information.

To add an *Access rule* to a user:

1. Select the user, then press *Access rules*, then press *+Access rule*.
2. Select a *Role* from the dropdown.
3. Press ![Scope](../../images/scope-icon.svg) then select a scope for the user. You can select multiple scopes.
4. After selecting all the required scopes, press *Save rule*.
5. To add another rule, use the *+Access rule*.
6. Press *Done* when all the rules are configured.
