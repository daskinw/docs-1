## Meaning

A Run:ai deployment has zero available pods.

## Impact

Run:ai may not be able to function, depending on the unavailable deployment.

## Severity

Critical

## Diagnosis

Run:
```
kubectl get deployment -n runai
kubectl get deployment -n runai-backend
```

Identify one or more deployments that have no running pods.

## Mitigation

Run:
```
kubectl describe deployment X -n runai/runai-backend
kubectl describe replicaset X -n runai/runai-backend
kubectl logs deployment/X -n runai/runai-backend
```

From the logs and deployment details, try and figure out why the deployment cannot create pods. 

If you cannot correct the issue, contact Run:ai support.
