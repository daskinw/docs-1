## Meaning

A Run:ai deployment has one or more unavailable pods.

## Impact

This alert may indicate scaling issues.
If a new version of the deployment can not be deployed, this may cause new features to be missing.

## Severity

Warning

## Diagnosis

Run:
```
kubectl get deployment -n runai
kubectl get deployment -n runai-backend
```

Identify one or more deployments that have missing pods.

## Mitigation

Run:
```
kubectl describe deployment X -n runai/runai-backend 
kubectl describe replicaset X -n runai/runai-backend 
kubectl logs deployment/X -n runai/runai-backend
```

From the logs and deployment details, try and figure out why the deployment cannot create pods. 

If you cannot correct the issue, contact Run:ai support.
