## Meaning

One or more of the Run:ai daemonsets has zero available pods on a relevant node.

## Impact

Fractional GPU workloads may not be working as expected.

## Severity

Critical

## Diagnosis

Run 
`kubectl get daemonset -n runai-backend` 

Identify the one or more daemonsets that have no running pods on some of the nodes.

## Mitigation

Run `kubectl describe daemonset X -n runai` on the relevant deamonset(s) to try and figure out why it cannot create pods. 

If you cannot correct the issue, contact Run:ai support.
