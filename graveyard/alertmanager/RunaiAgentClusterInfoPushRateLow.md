## Meaning

The `cluster-sync` pod in the `runai` namespace might not be functioning properly.

## Impact

No information or partial information from the cluster is being synced back to the Run:ai Control Plane.

## Severity

Critical

## Diagnosis

Run `kubectl get pod -n runai` to see if the `cluster-sync` pod is running.

## Mitigation

Run 
```
kubectl describe deployment cluster-sync -n runai 
kubectl logs deployment/cluster-sync -n runai
```

From the logs and pod details, try and figure out why the `cluster-sync` pod is not functioning properly.

It is possible that there is a connectivity issue from the cluster to the Run:ai Control Plane.

If the network is from the cluster to the Control Plane works as expected, and you cannot correct the issue, contact Run:ai support.
